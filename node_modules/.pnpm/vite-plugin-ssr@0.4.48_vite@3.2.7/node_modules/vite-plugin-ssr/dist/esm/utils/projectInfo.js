// Trick: since `utils/asserts.ts` depends on this file (`utils/projectInfo.ts`), we can have confidence that this file is always instantiated. So that we don't have to initialize this code snippet at every possible entry. (There are a *lot* of entries: `client/router/`, `client/`, `node/`, `node/plugin/`, `node/cli`, etc.)
addPackageInstance(projectInfo.projectVersion);
